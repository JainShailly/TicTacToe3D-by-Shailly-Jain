# TicTacToe3D-by-Shailly-Jain
This project is written in Java with JavaFx using JDK8 in IntelliJ IDEA.
This is an extended version of the Tic Tac Toe Game where we allow three players to make their move turn by turn.
All of the rules for this version of Tic Tac Toe are same as the rules for the 2D version.

You are free to download, use and edit this project. The complete source code is attached as a ZIP file for you to download.
You can see the attached image to have a look at preview of this game.

Enjoy Java Coding!!
